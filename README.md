# Graduation Project

My BUE graduation project, where I intended to accurately classify images usually found on Egyptian phones (Egyptian memes, academic photos, greetings/holiday images, etc.) using a model called EPIC: Egyptian Personal Images Classifier.

In-depth details about:
* the survey done on previous state-of-the-art models used on meme-related image classification problems
* the data scraping/processing/visualizations and ML/DL models used

are shown in the [project's dissertation paper](https://nbviewer.org/github/OdyAsh/graduation_project/blob/main/gp_related/documents/Ashraf%20196280%20-%20EPIC%20-%20GP%20Dissertation%20PDF.pdf).

(note: if the pdf takes too much time to load, [directly download it instead](./gp_related/documents/Ashraf%20196280%20-%20EPIC%20-%20GP%20Dissertation%20PDF.pdf))
